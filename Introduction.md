# Functional Analysis Notes

## Overview  
This repository contains structured notes, theorems, and solved examples in **Functional Analysis**, prepared during my MSc Mathematics & Computing at the **Central University of Andhra Pradesh**.  
The aim is to build a concise and rigorous reference for future research in **Pure Mathematics**.

## Contents  
- 📖 **Core Concepts** – Normed spaces, Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces.  
- 📝 **Solved Problems** – Worked examples from coursework and standard texts.  
- 🔍 **Key Theorems** – Hahn-Banach, Open Mapping, Closed Graph, Banach-Steinhaus.  
- 📚 **References** – Textbooks, lecture notes, and research articles.

## Usage  
- Written in **LaTeX/Markdown** for mathematical clarity.  
- Open to learners, researchers, and collaborators in analysis.  

## Future Work  
- Adding more exercises with detailed proofs.  
- Cross-linking with related areas (Real Analysis, Measure Theory).
